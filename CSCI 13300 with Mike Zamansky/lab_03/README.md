## lab_03
#### Samantha Ngo | CSCI 133 | 2018 September 23 | Hunter Daedalus Honors

##### This lab is a modified version of CSCI's 136, but practices implementing and using Catch2 and Makefiles.

Notes:
- Generally assumes that input is in correct format, but accommodates for some possible incorrect formats.
- When two dates are given as input, does not accommodate for dates that are in the incorrect order and will print out all dates from the first input date to the end of the year.
