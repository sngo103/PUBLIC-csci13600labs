##### This lab is an additional lab that practices writing a template class as well as implementing and using Catch2, Makefiles, and writing helper functions.

Notes:
- All functions assume correct input is given, within bounds and in appropriate datatype.
- There are no tests for incorrect input for functions that return T, except T get(int i) which is tested for index-out-of-bounds input by printing an error message in main.c.
- Any display functions are tested exclusively in main.c; any other uses will be for debugging of other functions.
- Tests.cpp only tests the datatypes double, int, and string.
