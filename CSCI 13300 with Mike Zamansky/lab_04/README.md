## lab_04
#### Samantha Ngo | CSCI 133 | 2018 September 27 | Hunter Daedalus Honors

##### This lab is a modified version of CSCI 136's lab_04, but practices implementing and using Catch2 and Makefiles.

Notes:
- For the TEST CASE for CROSS(SIZE) - NORMAL CASES, the tests appear to match the expected results when viewed in the terminal, but fail the tests and/or are not equivalent according to Catch2.
