## lab_07
#### Samantha Ngo | CSCI 133 | 2018 November 2 | Hunter Daedalus Honors

##### This lab is a modified version of CSCI 136's lab_07, but practices implementing and using Catch2, Makefiles, and writing helper functions.

Notes:
- I wasn't completely sure what you meant when you said "write a program(executable named main)," so I wrote my fixBadCode() function in the main.cpp file and kept my helper functions in self_indent.cpp. For example, some of my confusions were: am I supposed to write a function named main? or am I supposed to write the function in main.cpp? or do I just need to test it in my main executable main.cpp? or something else.
