## lab_11

##### This lab is a modified version of CSCI 136's lab_11, but practices implementing and using Catch2, Makefiles, and writing helper functions.

Notes:
- The function void printRange(int left, int right) is tested thoroughly in main.c rather than tests.cpp because it is expected to return void and print out the range. In order to test using Catch2, I would have needed to change the return type of the function which may cause problems on your end, possibly, so I chose to work around it this way.
