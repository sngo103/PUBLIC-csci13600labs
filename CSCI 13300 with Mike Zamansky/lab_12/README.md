## lab_12
#### Samantha Ngo | CSCI 133 | 2018 November 29 | Hunter Daedalus Honors

##### This lab is a modified version of CSCI 136's lab_12, but practices implementing and using Catch2, Makefiles, and writing helper functions.

Notes:
- The added functions bool follow(string usrn1, string usrn2) and void printDot() in Task C are only tested in main.cpp as they are mainly visualization functions or functions that require access to private variables for which accessor functions are not written for.
